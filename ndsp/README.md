Writing changes here for quanta-ndsp/mini_shutter since I don't have permissions to that repository.

[control_notebook.ipynb](control_notebook.ipynb) is a notebook used to send some commands to the ndsp server which goes to the RP2040. [aqctl_mini_shutter.py](aqctl_mini_shutter.py) is the ndsp server. [driver.py](driver.py) is what aqctl_mini_shutter.py uses. [main.py](main.py) is what goes on the RP2040. [shutter.py](shutter.py) is what main.py uses
