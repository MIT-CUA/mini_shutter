Writing changes here for quanta-ndsp/mini_shutter since I don't have permissions to that repository.
control_notebook.ipynb is a notebook used to send some commands to the ndsp server which goes to the RP2040.
aqctl_mini_shutter.py is the ndsp server
driver.py is what aqctl_mini_shutter.py uses
main.py is what goes on the RP2040
shutter.py is what main.py uses
